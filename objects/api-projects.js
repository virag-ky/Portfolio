      "This project is based on an external API, called FreeToGame API. The project was built through pair programming (by me and my partner) and it was our JavaScript capstone project. The data of the games, which is fetched from the API, gets displayed on the cards (title, description, additional information). The user can leave a comment on the game cards and give it a like also by clicking the heart icon.",
